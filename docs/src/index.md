# Welcome

EPHS is a compositional, energy-based (software) framework
for modeling mechanical, electromagnetic, and thermodynamic systems.

You are reading the documentation of
a [Julia](http://julialang.org) package
that implements EPHS
as an embedded domain specific modeling language
for interconnected/complex physical systems.

The implementation is based on the theory presented in
[*Exergetic Port-Hamiltonian Systems Modeling Language*](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378567463_Exergetic_Port-Hamiltonian_Systems_Modeling_Language).
Please consult this article for further details and references to other literature.


## Outline

* To read about closely related developments and the motivation behind this work, please have a look at the [Background](@ref) section.

* The [Fundamentals](@ref) section introduces directories, interconnection patterns, and the three kinds of primitive systems.

* To see the implementation in action, have a look at the [Examples](@ref) section.

* Our vision for the future is summarized on the [Vision](@ref) page.

* The last section provides a [Reference](@ref) for the Julia codebase.
