# [Current limitations and a vision for the future](@id Vision)

## Current limitations

1. The computer algebra system (CAS) used to express the equations/relations defining system behavior assumes that port variables (in particular state variables) are represented by real numbers, rather than elements of some vector space or more generally of a Lie group/algebra
2. EPHS.jl is research software (prototype)


## Advanced applications

More advanced applications, which would require that the implementation grows beyond the first limitation mentioned above:
