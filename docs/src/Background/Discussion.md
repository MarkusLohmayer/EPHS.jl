# Discussion

In this part we want to discuss how we would like to
unite and enhance the benefits of
bond graphs and port-Hamiltonian systems.

## Bond graphs

* subsystems are primitive elements

    * it would be nice to **allow arbitrarily complex subsystems**

* the composed system (network of elements) is itself closed

    * it would be nice to **allow open bond graphs** (outer interface)

* composition (i.e. hierarchical nesting) of bond graphs should then ...

    * **exist** whenever interfaces of systems match
    * be **unique**, given no further data than the bond graphs to be composed
    * be **associative** (unique flattened hierarchy of bond graphs)


## Port-Hamiltonian systems

* port-Hamiltonian systems compose according to extra data ("interconnecting Dirac structure")

    * it would be nice to have them **compose according to graphical syntax similar to bond graphs, that is composable just like the systems themselves**

* subsystems and their (inner) ports are not explicit in representations of port-Hamiltonian systems

    * it would be nice to have **subsystems and system interfaces as explicit parts of the framework**


## Conclusion

* bond graphs provide a network representation of systems, but the representation is not composable as such, at least not without specifying extra data

* port-Hamiltonian systems are composable, but composite systems are not defined using a graphical syntax similar to bond graphs

Can we combine these great inventions/discoveries to get something even more powerful?

Our answer is sketched out on the next page.
