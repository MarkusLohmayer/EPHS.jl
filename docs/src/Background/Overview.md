# Background

First, let's have a look at the historical/scientific background of this project. Specifically, we want to summarize and discuss the paradigms of energy-based modeling as well as port-based modeling of (classical) physical systems.
In the final part of the section, we want to outline how our approach integrates both paradigms.
