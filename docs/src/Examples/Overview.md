# Examples

In this section we want to showcase
how to use the `EPHS.jl` implementation
to model mechanical, electromagnetic, and thermodynamic systems
in a modular and hierarchical manner.
Similar to why functions are used in programming,
the EPHS language aims to simplify
the understanding, reuse, and modification
of possibly complex physical models.
